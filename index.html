          <h1>Roger Myers Bio: </h1>
          <p>
            I achieved a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science Computer Networking Systems in 2011 shortly after I started my career with <a href="https://www.pgpint.com">PGP International</a>.<br /><br />
            During my time with <a href="https://www.pgpint.com">PGP International</a> I have been involved in many projects including a greenfield site setup in Evansville Indiana where I lead the team of IT Engineers to install
            all of the Cabling, Wireless Access, ERP Management Network, Computers, Printers and Servers.<br /><br />

            Over the past decade I have been developing my skillsets while working for <a href="https://www.pgpint.com">PGP International</a> and leading the IT Support function. During this time I have learned the basics of coding,
            Website Development, ERP Systems Support, as well as business functions involved in running a manufacturing facility including Product Creation, Logistics and Procurement.<br /><br />

            Recently in 2022 I became the ERP System Specialist and took on additional duties including change management control, advanced system troubleshooting, and automation of key setups including a user creation management workflow using PowerAutomate.<br /></br>
            As part of this role I created a "System Resource Center" for the business using a combination of SharePoint, PowerAutomate, MS Forms, and other utilities to provide a single location for all IT system information.

            </p>
            <h3>Family:</h3>
            <p>
              I married my long time girlfriend Melanie Myers in June of 2019 and we expect a little baby boy, Dean in March 2022.
